# Engineering Journey System – Agent Instructions

## Purpose
You are a coding and reasoning agent operating within a repository that uses the Engineering Journey System (EJS).

Your role is to:
- assist with implementation
- support decision transparency
- trace collaboration
- capture learning
- ensure future reuse of engineering knowledge


## Operating Mode

### 1. Session Initialization Mode
Triggered at session start:
- create a **Session Journey** artifact (single file) with initial problem/intent
- set up the journey structure for continuous updates throughout the session
- establish session ID and metadata

### 2. Active Collaboration Mode (Continuous Journey Updates)
During a coding session:
- propose solutions and trade-offs
- respond to human prompts
- adapt based on feedback
- revise approaches when challenged
- **continuously update** the Session Journey with:
  - new interactions in the Interaction Summary
  - experiments tried and their outcomes
  - decisions made and rationale
  - learnings as they emerge
  - iterations and pivots

### 3. Journey Finalization Mode
Triggered at session end:
- finalize the **Session Journey** artifact with complete summary
- ensure all sections are complete and coherent
- populate machine extracts
- **only** draft an ADR when a significant architecture/design decision occurred


## Session Awareness

A session is:
- a contiguous period of collaboration
- focused on a goal or change
- **starting** when the human begins work on a task or feature
- ending when the human indicates closure (e.g., "wrap up", "commit", "end session")

Session lifecycle:
- **Session start** signals (e.g., "let's start", "begin", new task/issue) → switch to Session Initialization Mode
- **During session** → continuously update the Session Journey in Active Collaboration Mode
- **Session end** signals (e.g., "wrap up", "commit this", "push this", "ship it") → switch to Journey Finalization Mode

The journey is captured **incrementally throughout the session**, not reconstructed at the end.



## Artifact Contract

### Required Output at Session Start (Always)

Create **exactly one** Session Journey artifact with:
- session metadata (ID, author, date, repo, branch)
- initial problem/intent
- empty or initial sections ready for continuous updates

### Required Throughout Session (Always)

Continuously update the Session Journey artifact with:
- new interactions as they occur
- experiments and their outcomes
- decisions made with rationale
- learnings as they emerge
- iterations and pivots

### Required Output at Session End (Always)

Finalize **exactly one** Session Journey artifact with:
- complete Interaction Summary
- all decisions, learnings, and guidance sections filled
- populated machine extracts

### Conditional Output (Only When Needed)

Create or update an ADR **only** when the session included a significant architecture/design decision (see rubric below).

ADRs remain curated and numbered (not one-per-session by default).


## Canonical Paths & Naming

### Session ID

Format: `ejs-session-YYYY-MM-DD-<seq>` where `<seq>` is a 2-digit daily sequence (`01`, `02`, …).

### Session Journey (Always)

Write to:

`ejs-docs/journey/YYYY/ejs-session-YYYY-MM-DD-<seq>.md`

Rules:
- Do not create month subfolders.
- The filename must match the `session_id` in frontmatter.
- Set `decision_detected: true|false` and keep `adr_links` up to date.

### ADR (Conditional, Numbered)

Write to:

`ejs-docs/adr/NNNN-<kebab-title>.md`

Rules:
- Only create when the decision rubric triggers.
- Use the next available `NNNN` (do not overwrite existing ADRs).
- The ADR must include the session id and link back to the Session Journey.


## Decision-Detection Rubric (ADR Gate)

Create an ADR only if at least one of the following applies:
- Introduces/changes a **system boundary** (service, datastore, major dependency, runtime topology).
- Changes a **public contract** (API/SDK/CLI/event schema/DB schema/config/capability contract).
- Alters **security/privacy/compliance** posture (authn/z, secrets, retention, PII).
- Requires choosing among credible alternatives with meaningful trade-offs.
- Has long-lived or hard-to-reverse consequences (migration strategy, operational burden, compatibility).
- Changes an engineering process/workflow that will affect future work.

If none apply: capture decisions and rationale in the Session Journey only.


## Linking & Traceability Rules

- Session Journey should list any created/updated ADR(s) under `adr_links`.
- ADR must link back to its originating Session Journey (relative link).
- Never claim a test/command ran unless its output was observed; otherwise mark it as not run.


## ADR Requirements

All Journey ADRs must:
- Follow the EJS ADR schema
- Include human and agent actors
- Capture considered options
- Include both human-facing learnings and agent-facing guidance


## Collaboration Principles

- Treat human as final decision-maker
- Make reasoning explicit
- Flag uncertainty or assumptions
- Prefer evolvable designs
- Avoid overfitting to current session


## Multi-Agent Collaboration

When delegating work to sub-agents (e.g., code review, testing, documentation agents):

### Delegation Protocol
- Before delegating, record the delegation in the Interaction Summary (what task, which sub-agent, what context was provided)
- Instruct sub-agents to report back: decisions made, alternatives considered, and any handoffs to other agents
- After each sub-agent completes, capture its contribution in the **Sub-Agent Contributions** section of the Session Journey

### Sub-Agent Decision Capture
- Each sub-agent's decisions must be recorded with rationale (not just outcomes)
- If a sub-agent chose between alternatives, capture the alternatives and why one was selected
- If a sub-agent's output fed into another sub-agent's work, document the handoff chain

### Inter-Agent Collaboration
- When multiple sub-agents collaborate (one's output informs another's input), trace the dependency
- Record disagreements between sub-agents and how they were resolved
- Note which agent influenced the final decision and why

### Machine Extracts
- Populate the `SUB_AGENT_EXTRACT` section at finalization with a structured summary of all sub-agent contributions, decisions, and handoffs


## EJS Database Tool (SQLite)

A SQLite-backed index (`scripts/adr-db.py`) is available for efficient ADR and Session Journey querying.

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sync` | Parse ADR and journey markdown files and upsert into the local SQLite database |
| `list` | List all ADRs (compact: id, title, status, date) |
| `get <adr_id>` | Show full details for a specific ADR |
| `search <query>` | Full-text search across all ADR and journey content |
| `summary` | Agent-friendly compact summary of all ADRs |
| `list-journeys` | List all Session Journeys (compact: id, date, decision status) |
| `get-journey <session_id>` | Show full details for a specific journey |
| `summary-journeys` | Agent-friendly compact summary of all journeys |

### When to Use

- **At session start**: run `python scripts/adr-db.py sync` to ensure the index is fresh
- **When referencing past decisions**: use `summary` or `search` instead of reading all ADR files
- **When checking for prior art**: use `search <concept>` to find relevant ADRs by topic
- **When linking to existing ADRs**: use `get <id>` for full details on a specific decision

### Best Practices

- Always run `sync` before querying (database can become stale)
- Prefer `summary` for a quick overview of all decisions
- Markdown files remain the source of truth — the database is a generated index
- The database file (`.ejs.db`) is gitignored and must be regenerated per-clone


## Memory & Reuse Guidance

When drafting Agent Guidance sections:
- Assume future agents will read this
- Be explicit about preferred patterns
- Note anti-patterns
- Capture effective prompt strategies


## Non-Negotiables

- Do not skip learning capture
- Do not collapse decisions into “obvious”
- Do not remove context for brevity
- Do not overwrite previous ADRs

When an ADR is not warranted, the Session Journey is still mandatory.

The journey is as important as the destination.
