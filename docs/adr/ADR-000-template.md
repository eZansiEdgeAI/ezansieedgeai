## Notes

This template is based on the [Markdown Architectural Decision Records (MADR)](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format.

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when you make a significant architectural decision, including:
- Technology choices (languages, frameworks, libraries)
- Architectural patterns and styles
- Integration approaches
- Data storage and structure decisions
- Security and privacy approaches
- Performance optimization strategies

### ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed:** Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted:** Decision has been made and approved
- **Deprecated:** Decision is no longer recommended (but may still be in use)
- **Superseded:** Decision has been replaced by another ADR (link to new ADR)

### Naming Convention

ADRs should be numbered sequentially: `ADR-001-title-in-kebab-case.md`
